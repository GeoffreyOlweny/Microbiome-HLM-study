Microbiome HLM Study: Airway Microbiome Analysis Protocol for Characterizing a Novel TB Signature
This repository contains the protocol and accompanying code for the Airway Microbiome Analysis to characterize a novel TB signature.

The protocol involves:
Data processing and quality control
Calculation of microbiome diversity measures
Implementation of a Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model
Assessment of taxonomic relative and differential abundances
Biomarker identification to discriminate Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection status
This protocol is detailed in the publication by Kayongo et al. (2024), providing a comprehensive guide for analyzing airway microbiome data.

Repository Structure
data/: Directory containing raw and processed data.
scripts/: Directory with R scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
results/: Directory where analysis outputs, such as plots and tables, are stored.
README.md: This file, provides an overview of the repository.
