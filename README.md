# Microbiome HLM Study: Airway Microbiome Analysis Protocol for Characterizing a Novel TB Signature

This repository contains the protocol and accompanying code for the Airway Microbiome Analysis to characterize a novel TB signature.

## Overview

This protocol involves the following steps:

1. **Data processing and quality control**
2. **Calculation of microbiome diversity measures**
3. **Implementation of a Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture (DMM) model**
4. **Assessment of taxonomic relative and differential abundances**
5. **Biomarker identification** to discriminate Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection status

This protocol is detailed in the publication by Kayongo et al. (2024), providing a comprehensive guide for analyzing airway microbiome data.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Directory containing raw and processed data.
- **results/**: Directory where analysis outputs, such as plots and tables, are stored.
